Creating a Geographic Information System (GIS) Analysis: 
This project involves analyzing geographic data such as maps and spatial data.
we have a database that supports spatial data types, like PostgreSQL (PostGIS).

1) Retrieve Locations of specific features

2) Calculate the Distance between points

3) Calculate Areas of Interest (specific to each group)

4) Analyze the queries

5) Sorting and Limit Executions

6) Optimize the queries to speed up execution time

7) N-Optimization of queries
